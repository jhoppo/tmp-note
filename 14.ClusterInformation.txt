5. Which suffix will static pods have that run on cluster1-worker1?
  A: use command "k get pods -n kube-system" to find out the suffix pattern
  e.g.:
    etcd-m1                           1/1     Running   5          3d20h
    kube-apiserver-m1                 1/1     Running   5          3d20h
    kube-controller-manager-m1        1/1     Running   5          3d20h
    kube-scheduler-m1                 1/1     Running   0          39h
  As we can see, m1 is the suffix pattern for the static pods
  ref answer: -m1
